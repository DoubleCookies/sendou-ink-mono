## Contributing

Everything is still very much work in progress but the basic idea is that [any issue that isn't assigned to me](https://github.com/Sendouc/sendou-ink-mono/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee+-label%3Ablocked) I'm happy to accept help on.

If you want to see someone or yourself work on something that isn't reported as issue yet then please make one first.
